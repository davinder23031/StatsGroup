**Diabetes Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning**  
This repository contains a comprehensive project on predicting diabetes risk using machine learning models. The project leverages data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset, which includes health statistics and lifestyle survey data of over 400,000 individuals.  

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques to handle missing values, feature engineering, and dataset reduction for improved performance.  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Hypothesis testing to explore associations between diabetes and factors like smoking, physical activity, and alcohol consumption.  
- **Model Training**: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and others, with comparisons on scaled and unscaled datasets.  
- **Challenges and Solutions**: Addressing large dataset size, missing values, and model overfitting through innovative approaches.  

### Future Scopes:
- Integration with real-time data for continuous monitoring.  
- Personalization through advanced models and genetic data inclusion.  
- Scalability for broader populations and international applications.
